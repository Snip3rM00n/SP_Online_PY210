# Anthony McKeever's SP_Online_PY210 Course Materials

*"I'm fine with failure, so long as I know the results were deserved."* - Suzukaze Aoba (New Game!! - Season 2 Episode 2)

## Purpose

The purpose of this folder is to contain Anthony McKeever's course work based on the materials of the UW Python Certificate Program's Programming in Python (PY210) course.

## Structure

Each course lesson will contain its own folder.  The folders will use the naming convesion `lessonX` where `X` will be the lesson number.  For example, anything for Lesson 1 will be in the `lesson1` directory.

### Source Map:
```

## Branching

Branching will be done for each lesson so as to not polute master with in development and potentially buggy code.  Each branch go through a self code review to ensure quality and completeness before merging into `Snip3rM00n/SP_OnlinePy201/Master`.  After all items for the lesson or activity are in `Snip3rM00n/SP_OnlinePy201/Master` they will then be sent as a PR to Upstream (UWPCE-PythonCert-ClassReops/SP_OnlinePy201).
