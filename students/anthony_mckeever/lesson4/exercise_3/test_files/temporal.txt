The Department of Temporal Integrity: 
All unified governments of Andromeda share some departments.  Most notably is the Department of Temporal Integrity.
After Kima Metoyo created the Flower of Memories while working for the Kayomi Matsuka Cosmetics Corporation and developed
the technology behind time travel she was offered the opportunity to form the Department of Temporal Integrity by the NAGO
Department of Assignment and Relocation.  She was reluctant to start the department, however after solving the Déjà Vu Crisis
(See: Universe Time Skipping) agreed to the assignment.  When she formed the department, she (and her colleagues) traveled to
the times of the establishment of the various government and formed the department.  The department operates on the express
mission of protecting the timeline from alteration, incursion and recursion (see AIR).

The department's seal depicts a winged hourglass with the seals of the three major Andromedan Unified Governments (EUG/AHC/NAGO)
behind it forming a triangle.  Between the government seals are arrows pointing towards each seal forming a circle.  The letters
‘A’, ‘I’, and ‘R’ are next to the center points of each arrow forming an inverse triangle.  A banner in front of the hourglass reads
"Tempus Fugit MMCCCLIII" (MMCCCLIII – 2353, is the year the universe’s timeline skips back to an earlier date, See: Déjà Vu Crisis).
The seal is lined with the text " * AHC Department of Temporal Integrity * NAGO Department of Temporal Integrity * 2353".

The department's three members (Kima Metoyo, Astra Matsume, and Delilah Matsuka) are the only three people in the (known) universe
who are authorized by the various Andromedan governments to alter the timeline for the purposes of preventing incursions and recursion
and are authorized to take any action necessary to protect the timeline.
